## 👋 About me

I’m a <b>software engineer</b> with a strong backend foundation in the <b>.NET ecosystem</b> and growing experience building modern web platforms with <b>Next.js</b> and <b>Angular</b>.

I enjoy turning messy requirements into clean systems, working close to data, <b>APIs</b>, and <b>business rules</b>. I care about <strong>structure</strong>, <strong>readability</strong>, and <strong>shipping things that don’t collapse six months later</strong>.

I’m also a musician—composition and improvisation trained my brain to recognize patterns, iterate deliberately, and stay patient with complex systems.

## 🎸 Outside of code

Musician and composer, working with Ableton Live.  
Music keeps my engineering honest: structure matters, timing matters, and practice compounds.
