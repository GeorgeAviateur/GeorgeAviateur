## 👋 About me

I’m a software engineer with a strong backend foundation in the .NET ecosystem and growing experience building modern web platforms with Next.js and Angular.

I enjoy turning messy requirements into clean systems, working close to data, APIs, and business rules. I care about structure, readability, and shipping things that don’t collapse six months later.

I’m also a musician—composition and improvisation trained my brain to recognize patterns, iterate deliberately, and stay patient with complex systems.

## 🎸 Outside of code

Musician and composer, working with Ableton Live.  
Music keeps my engineering honest: structure matters, timing matters, and practice compounds.

## 🌍 What I’m aiming for

Building production-grade software with international teams, improving my system design depth, and contributing to products that scale beyond “it works on my machine.”
